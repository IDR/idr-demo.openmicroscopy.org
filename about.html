                        <p>This Award provided support for the continued development of the OME Data Model, Bio-Formats file translation library and OMERO application in Dundee, as well as funding development positions in nine other laboratories. In 2014, this Strategic Award was extended into 2015 and supplemented by further funding from BBSRC in 2015/16 (BB/M018423/1, BB/L024233/1 and BB/G022585/1). The development of the Image Data Repository (IDR) is also funded by two EU Horizon 2020 awards (“Coordinated Research Infrastructures Building Enduring Life-science services (CORBEL)” Ref: 654248 and “Euro-BioImaging Preparatory Phase II” Ref: 688945).</p>
