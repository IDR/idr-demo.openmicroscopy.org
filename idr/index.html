This online, public resource seeks to store, integrate and serve image datasets from published scientific studies. We have collected and are continuing to receive existing and newly created “reference” image datasets that are valuable resources for a broad community of users, either because they will be frequently accessed and cited or because they can serve as a basis for re-analysis and the development of new computational tools.</h3>

                        <p>The IDR aims to make datasets that have never previously been accessible publicly available, allowing the community to search, view, mine and even process and analyze large complex multidimensional life sciences image data. Sharing data promotes the validation of experimental methods and scientific conclusions, the comparison with new data obtained by scientists around the world, and allows the possibility of data reuse by developers of new analysis and processing tools.</p>        
                        <p>All datasets have been annotated with author-supplied metadata (e.g., annotations, defined regions, feature vectors and ontological annotations) which are all stored and available for browsing. All metadata are also available through the OMERO API.</p>
