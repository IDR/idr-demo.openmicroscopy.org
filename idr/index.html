This online, public resource seeks to store, integrate and serve image datasets from published scientific studies. We have collected and are continuing to receive existing and newly created “reference” image datasets that are valuable resources for a broad community of users, either because they will be frequently accessed and cited or because they can serve as a basis for re-analysis and the development of new computational tools.</h3>

                        <p>The IDR aims to make datasets that have never previously been accessible publicly available, allowing the community to search, view, mine and even process and analyze large complex multidimensional life sciences image data. Sharing data promotes the validation of experimental methods and scientific conclusions, the comparison with new data obtained by scientists around the world, and allows the possibility of data reuse by developers of new analysis and processing tools.</p>        
                        <p>All datasets have been annotated with author-supplied metadata (e.g., annotations, defined regions, feature vectors and ontological annotations) which are all stored and available for browsing. All metadata are also available through the OMERO API.</p>

                        <p>IDR uses OME’s Bio-Formats and OMERO tools to read, manage and serve data, and provide links to EMBL-EBI’s molecular and structural resources. The resource is built upon EMBL-EBI’s OpenStack-based Embassy infrastructure. All tools used for reading and converting metadata associated with each dataset are available and all scripts used to build the infrastructure are maintained and available. We will be extending the system to enable computational re-analysis of the data.</p>

                        <p>Currently the IDR contains 35 Tb of multi-dimensional image data consisting of 26 million individual planes from 20 different imaging studies. Data comes from studies on human, Drosophila, budding and fission yeast, and mouse cells. Imaging modalities included so far include high content screens and histopathology, super-resolution and 3D-SIM datasets.</p>
